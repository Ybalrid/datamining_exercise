How to build.

You need CMake to create a makefile, or a project for Visual Sutdio, or whatever tools you want to use.

These programs are written in C++14.

Basic CMake outline for Linux

```bash

cd build
cmake ..
make

```

For windows, use the GUI, set sources as the root directory of the repository, the build/binary one as the "build" subfolder.

You can generate a Visual Studio Solution or makefile for MinGW by clicking "configure" then "generate"
